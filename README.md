# pokesml
Pokemon Battle Simulator in SML. This will not support a GUI and will run via a CLI

# Why
We thought that a Pokemon battle simulator would be a fun toy project that has
enough design challenges/problems to demonstrate the power of SML's module
system. This project is about writing abstracted code, not necessarily about
writing the best Pokemon battle simulator.

# Scope
The project will include the following, if a feature of Pokemon is not listed it
is not supported:
1. Gen 1 and Gen 2 Pokemon - enough to have demonstrate the benefits of modularity
2. Pokemon Types in battle
2. A command line interface for user input for the battle

# Stretch Goals
Given time and interest, our stretch goals include:
1. Implementation of Status Effects
2. Swapping Pokemon out in battle

# Running the Simulator
TODO

# Actions in Combat
TODO
